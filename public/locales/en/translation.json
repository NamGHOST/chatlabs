  "SYSTEM_PROMPT_DESCRIPTION": "The system prompt is a message that the AI will use to start the conversation. It should contain the following dynamic variables for ImogenAI functioning properly: {profile_context}, {local_date}, and {assistant}. {profile_context} is the user's profile context, {local_date} is the current date, and {assistant} is the name of the assistant and it's instructions.",
  "TEMPERATURE_DESCRIPTION": "Temperature is a value that affects the randomness of AI model responses. Higher temperatures make responses more random, while lower temperatures make responses more deterministic.",
  "CONTEXT_LENGTH_DESCRIPTION": "The context length impacts the AI's grasp of chat history; longer contexts slow response but provide more history, while shorter ones increase speed and cut costs, as charges depend on the processed information volume.",

  "WAITING_MESSAGES": "In the pipe, five by five...|Imogen is finding a proper agent...|Connecting to your neural network...|AI remind: You forgot to say thank you...|Please wait a moment...|AI is training with its data now..."
