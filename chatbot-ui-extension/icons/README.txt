To fix the icon error, you need to add an icon file named 'icon48.png' in this folder.

You can:
1. Use any 48x48 pixel PNG image
2. Save it as 'icon48.png' in this folder
3. A simple robot or chat bubble icon works well

For testing, you can download a simple icon from:
https://www.google.com/favicon.ico
and rename it to icon48.png

Or create your own 48x48 PNG icon.
